# kickass_data_portfolio
A portfolio exhibiting some of my Data Analysis/Data Science projects. 

# Project 1: [Analyzed 2 years of historical data for an app that connects pet owners with people who would like to take care of pets or provide pet services. Joined 8 tables and made all kind of analysis: how many services were given, how many users we had, how did we acquire users, what is the evolution of the price, how is customer acquisition changing, what strategies worked vs which didn't, average number of pets in a service, and many other indicators.](https://github.com/jd057/project_pet_app)

# Project 2: [Analyzed 5 days worth of information of user behavior in a webpage designed to help you rent high-end, furnished apartments in various cities for longer stays than your average Airbnb (3 months minimum). There are 1.5 million events recorded in that timeframe, and a lot of answers to uncover. Created and examined KPIs such as number of different sessions, users, the time of the sessions, the conversions, most and least popular events, average events by sessions and user, top X visitors, what is common behaviour when we have a purchase vs not, and much more.](https://github.com/jd057/project_user_behavior)

# Project 3: [Analyzed a dataset with 2471 orders, to find insights about the customer delivery time, delivery distance, orders couriers rejected, time of service and much more.](https://github.com/jd057/project_qcommerce)

# Project 4: [Analyzed a dataset of 2139 items to discover what are the items that are rented the most, returned the most, checked a lot on the webpage but with terrible conversion. Also looked at the price of renting the item for different periods of time vs the price of buying the item brand new, the efficacy of different subscription prices and the performance of different plans, diving into over the results after 6 months of activity. All of this, and more.](https://github.com/jd057/project_rent_tech)
